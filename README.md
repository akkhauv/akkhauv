## Hello!
I'm Amber, a junior in CS at Purdue University. Here are my main projects:

- [SlayterHIL](https://github.com/embedded-purdue/slayterHIL): A Hardware-in-the-Loop drone simulation system. PM & Firmware Developer
- [Zephyr](https://github.com/akkhauv/zephyr-spi-target-demo/tree/main): Isolated modules as I attempt to add SPI ESP32 Slave and Bit-bang support to the Zephyr codebase.
- [RISCVBusiness](https://github.com/Purdue-SoCET/RISCVBusiness/tree/test-cleanup): The CPU core of the SoC I do firmware and verification for. Unfortunately, the main repo is private.
- [GPOS Dev](https://github.com/Purdue-SoCET/gpos-dev): Bare-metal OS running on the aforementioend ^ SoC. Nothing interesting here yet--check back in a month!
